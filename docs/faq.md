## How can I contact the developers?

The best place to discuss SSM with developers and other community members is the [github discussion page](https://github.com/shatteredsilicon/ssm-submodules/discussions).

If you would like to report a bug, use the [github issue page](https://github.com/shatteredsilicon/ssm-submodules/issues).

## What are the minimum system requirements for SSM?

### SSM Server

Any system which can run Docker version 1.12.6 or later.

It needs roughly 1 GB of storage for each monitored database node with data retention set to one week.

!!! alert alert-info "Note"
    By default, retention is set to 30 days for Metrics Monitor and to 8 days for Query Analytics.  Also consider disabling table statistics, which can greatly decrease Prometheus database size.

Minimum memory is 2 GB for one monitored database node, but it is not linear when you add more nodes.  For example, data from 20 nodes should be easily handled with 16 GB.

### SSM Client

Any modern 64-bit Linux distribution. It is tested on the latest versions of Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Minimum 100 MB of storage is required for installing the SSM Client package.  With good constant connection to SSM Server, additional storage is not required.  However, the client needs to store any collected data that it is not able to send over immediately, so additional storage may be required if connection is unstable or throughput is too low.

## How to control data retention for SSM?

By default, Prometheus stores time-series data for 30 days, and QAN stores query data for 8 days.

Depending on available disk space and your requirements, you may need to adjust data retention time.

You can control data retention by passing the `METRICS_RETENTION` and `QUERIES_RETENTION` environment variables when creating and running the SSM Server container.  To set environment variables, use the `-e` option.  The value should be the number of hours, minutes, or seconds. For example, the default value of 30 days for `METRICS_RETENTION` is `720h`.  You probably do not need to be more precise than the number hours, so you can discard the minutes and seconds.  For example, to decrease the retention period for Prometheus to 8 days:

```
-e METRICS_RETENTION=192h
```

## Where are the services created by SSM Client?

When you add a monitoring instance using the **ssm-admin** tool, it creates a corresponding service.  The name of the service has the following syntax:

`ssm-<type>`

For example: `ssm-mysql-metrics`.

The location of the services depends on the service manager:

| Service manager  | Service location       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `systemd`        | `/etc/systemd/system/` |
| `upstart`        | `/etc/init/`           |
| `systemv`        | `/etc/init.d/`         |

To see which service manager is used on your system, run as root **ssm-admin info**.

## Where is DSN stored?

Every service created by **ssm-admin** when you add a monitoring instance gets a DSN from the credentials provided, auto-detected, or created (when adding the instance with the `--create-user` option).

For MySQL and MongoDB metrics instances (`mysql:metrics` and `mongodb:metrics` services), the DSN is stored with the corresponding service files.  For more information, see Where are the services created by SSM Client?.

For QAN instances (`mysql:queries` service), the DSN is stored in local configuration files under `/opt/ss/qan-agent`.

Also, a sanitized copy of DSN (without the passowrd) is stored in Consul API for information purposes (used by the **ssm-admin list** command).

## Where are SSM Client log files located?

Every service created by **ssm-admin** when you add a monitoring instance has a separate log file located in `/var/log/`.  The file names have the following syntax: `ssm-<type>.log`.

For example, the log file for the MySQL QAN monitoring service is `/var/log/ssm-mysql-queries.log`.

You can view all available monitoring instance types and corresponding ports using the **ssm-admin list** command.  For more information, see Listing monitoring services.

## How often are nginx logs in SSM Server rotated?

SSM Server runs `logrotate` to rotate nginx logs on a daily basis and keep up to 10 latest log files.

## What are common performance considerations?

If a MySQL server has a lot of schemas or tables, it is recommended to disable per table metrics when adding the instance:

```
$ sudo ssm-admin add mysql --disable-tablestats
```

!!! alert alert-info "Note"
    Table statistics are disabled automatically if there are over 1 000 tables.

For more information, run as root **ssm-admin add** `mysql --help`.

## Can I stop all services at once?

Yes, you can use **ssm-admin** to start and stop either individual services that correspond to the added monitoring instances, or all of them at once.

To stop all services:

```
$ sudo ssm-admin stop --all
```

To start all services:

```
$ sudo ssm-admin start --all
```

For more information about starting and stopping services, see [Starting monitoring services](ssm-admin.md).

You can view all available monitoring instances and the states of the corresponding services using the **ssm-admin list** command. For more information, see [Listing monitoring services](ssm-admin.md).

## What privileges are required to monitor a MySQL instance?

See Creating a MySQL User Account to Be Used with SSM.

## Can I monitor multiple MySQL instances?

Yes, you can add multiple MySQL instances to be monitored from one SSM Client.  In this case, you will need to provide a distinct port and socket for each instance using the `--port` and `--socket` parameters, and specify a unique name for each instance (by default, it uses the name of the SSM Client host).

For example, if you are adding complete MySQL monitoring for two local MySQL servers, the commands could look similar to the following:

```
$ sudo ssm-admin add mysql --user root --password root --create-user --port 3001 instance-01
$ sudo ssm-admin add mysql --user root --password root --create-user --port 3002 instance-02
```

For more information, run **ssm-admin add** `mysql --help`.

## Can I rename instances?

You can remove any monitoring instance as described in Removing monitoring services and then add it back with a different name.

When you remove a monitoring service, previously collected data remains available in Grafana.  However, the metrics are tied to the instance name.  So if you add the same instance back with a different name, it will be considered a new instance with a new set of metrics.  So if you are re-adding an instance and want to keep its previous data, add it with the same name.

## Can I use non-default ports for instances?

When you add an instance with the **ssm-admin** tool, it creates a corresponding service that listens on a predefined client port:

| General OS metrics | `linux:metrics`      | 42000 |
| MySQL metrics      | `mysql:metrics`      | 42002 |
| MongoDB metrics    | `mongodb:metrics`    | 42003 |
| ProxySQL metrics   | `proxysql:metrics`   | 42004 |
| PostgreSQL metrics | `postgresql:metrics` | 42005 |

If a default port for the service is not available, **ssm-admin** automatically chooses a different port.

If you want to assign a different port, use the `--service-port` option when adding instances.

## How to troubleshoot communication issues between SSM Client and SSM Server?

There is a `ssm-admin check-network` command, which [checks connectivity](ssm-admin.md) between SSM Client and SSM Server and presents the summary of this check in a human readable form.

Broken network connectivity may be caused by rather wide set of reasons. Particularly, when using Docker, the container is constrained by the host-level routing and firewall rules. For example, your hosting provider might have default *iptables* rules on their hosts that block communication between SSM Server and SSM Client, resulting in *DOWN* targets in Prometheus. If this happens, check firewall and routing settings on the Docker host.

Also SSM is able to generate a set of diagnostics data which can be examined and/or shared with Shattered Silicon Support to solve an issue faster. You can get collected logs from SSM Client [using the ssm-admin command](ssm-admin.md). Obtaining logs from SSM Server can be done either [by specifying the URL](deploy/index.md) or by clicking the `server logs` link on the [Prometheus dashboard](dashboard.prometheus.md):

## What resolution is used for metrics?

The `mysql:metrics` service collects metrics with different resolutions (1 second, 5 seconds, and 60 seconds)

The `linux:metrics` and `mongodb:metrics` services are set up to collect metrics with 1 second resolution.

In case of bad network connectivity between SSM Server and SSM Client or between SSM Client and the database server it is monitoring, scraping every second may not be possible when latency is higher than 1 second.  You can change the minimum resolution for metrics by passing the `METRICS_RESOLUTION` environment variable when creating and running the SSM Server container.  To set this environment variable, use the `-e` option. The values can be between *1s* (default) and *5s*.  If you set a higher value, Prometheus will not start.

For example, to set the minimum resolution to 3 seconds:

**-e METRICS_RESOLUTION=3s**

!!! alert alert-info "Note"
    Consider increasing minimum resolution when SSM Server and SSM Client are on different networks, or when Adding an Amazon RDS DB instance to SSM.

## Why do I get `Failed ReadTopologyInstance` error when adding MySQL host to Orchestrator?

You need to create Orchestratorâ€™s topology user on MySQL according to this section.

## How to install the experimental version of SSM Server?

If you would like to experiment with the latest development version using Docker, you may go to https://dl.shatteredsilicon.net/ssm-dev/8/, download the exported docker image and import it. This version, however, is not intended to be used in a production environment.

```
$ curl -O https://dl.shatteredsilicon.net/ssm-dev/8/ssm-server-x86_64-8.7.1.17.5.2-1.dev.20230709.21.10.tgz
$ docker import ssm-server-x86_64-8.7.1.17.5.2-1.dev.20230709.21.10.tgz
```

!!! alert alert-warning "Important"
    This is a development version which is not designed for a production environment.
