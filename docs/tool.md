# Tools of SSM

You can access the SSM web interface using the IP address of the host where SSM Server is running.  For example, if SSM Server is running on a host with IP 192.168.100.1, access the following address with your web browser: `http://192.168.100.1`.

The SSM home page that opens provides an overview of the environment that you have set up to monitor by using [`ssm-admin`](ssm-admin.md).

From the SSM home page, you can access specific monitoring tools, or dashboards. Each dashboard features a collection of metrics. These are graphs of a certain type that represent one specific aspect showing how metric values change over time.

By default the SSM home page lists most recently used dashboards and helpful links to the information that may be useful to understand SSM better.

The SSM home page lists all hosts that you have set up for monitoring as well as the essential details about their performance such as CPU load, disk performance, or network activity.
