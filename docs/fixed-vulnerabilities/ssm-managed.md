| CVE-2021-38561 | pkg:golang/golang.org/x/text@v0.3.0 | [CVE-2021-38561] CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read | golang.org/x/text/language in golang.org/x/text before 0.3.7 can panic with an out-of-bounds read during BCP 47 language tag parsing. Index calculation is mishandled. If parsing untrusted user input, this can be used as a vector for a denial-of-service attack. | 7.5 | https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2021-38561?component-type=golang&component-name=golang.org%2Fx%2Ftext&utm_source=nancy-client&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=1.0.42 |
| CVE-2020-14040 | pkg:golang/golang.org/x/text@v0.3.0 | [CVE-2020-14040] CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | The x/text package before 0.3.3 for Go has a vulnerability in encoding/unicode that could lead to the UTF-16 decoder entering an infinite loop, causing the program to crash or run out of memory. An attacker could provide a single byte to a UTF16 decoder instantiated with UseBOM or ExpectBOM to trigger an infinite loop if the String function on the Decoder is called, or the Decoder is passed to golang.org/x/text/transform.String. | 7.5 | https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2020-14040?component-type=golang&component-name=golang.org%2Fx%2Ftext&utm_source=nancy-client&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=1.0.42 |

| CVE-2022-2582 | pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.15.48 | [CVE-2022-2582] CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength | The AWS S3 Crypto SDK sends an unencrypted hash of the plaintext alongside the ciphertext as a metadata field. This hash can be used to brute force the plaintext, if the hash is readable to the attacker. AWS now blocks this metadata field, but older SDK versions still send it. | 4.3 | https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2022-2582?component-type=golang&component-name=github.com%2Faws%2Faws-sdk-go&utm_source=nancy-client&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=1.0.42 |
| CVE-2020-8912 | pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.15.48 | [CVE-2020-8912] CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | A vulnerability in the in-band key negotiation exists in the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. An attacker with write access to the targeted bucket can change the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can then allow them to change AES-GCM to AES-CTR. Using this in combination with a decryption oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as decrypting the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an algebraic equation. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files. | 2.5 | https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2020-8912?component-type=golang&component-name=github.com%2Faws%2Faws-sdk-go&utm_source=nancy-client&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=1.0.42 |
| CVE-2020-8911 | pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.15.48 | [CVE-2020-8911] CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | A padding oracle vulnerability exists in the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. The SDK allows users to encrypt files with AES-CBC without computing a Message Authentication Code (MAC), which then allows an attacker who has write access to the target's S3 bucket and can observe whether or not an endpoint with access to the key can decrypt a file, they can reconstruct the plaintext with (on average) 128*length (plaintext) queries to the endpoint, by exploiting CBC's ability to manipulate the bytes of the next block and PKCS5 padding errors. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files. | 5.6 | https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2020-8911?component-type=golang&component-name=github.com%2Faws%2Faws-sdk-go&utm_source=nancy-client&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=1.0.42 |
