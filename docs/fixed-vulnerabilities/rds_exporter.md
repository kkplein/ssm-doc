| CVE-2022-2582 | pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.25.45 | [CVE-2022-2582] CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength | The AWS S3 Crypto SDK sends an unencrypted hash of the plaintext alongside the ciphertext as a metadata field. This hash can be used to brute force the plaintext, if the hash is readable to the attacker. AWS now blocks this metadata field, but older SDK versions still send it. | 4.3 | https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2022-2582?component-type=golang&component-name=github.com%2Faws%2Faws-sdk-go&utm_source=nancy-client&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=1.0.42 |
| CVE-2020-8912 | pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.25.45 | [CVE-2020-8912] CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | A vulnerability in the in-band key negotiation exists in the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. An attacker with write access to the targeted bucket can change the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can then allow them to change AES-GCM to AES-CTR. Using this in combination with a decryption oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as decrypting the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an algebraic equation. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files. | 2.5 | https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2020-8912?component-type=golang&component-name=github.com%2Faws%2Faws-sdk-go&utm_source=nancy-client&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=1.0.42 |
| CVE-2020-8911 | pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.25.45 | [CVE-2020-8911] CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | A padding oracle vulnerability exists in the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. The SDK allows users to encrypt files with AES-CBC without computing a Message Authentication Code (MAC), which then allows an attacker who has write access to the target's S3 bucket and can observe whether or not an endpoint with access to the key can decrypt a file, they can reconstruct the plaintext with (on average) 128*length (plaintext) queries to the endpoint, by exploiting CBC's ability to manipulate the bytes of the next block and PKCS5 padding errors. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files. | 5.6 | https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2020-8911?component-type=golang&component-name=github.com%2Faws%2Faws-sdk-go&utm_source=nancy-client&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=1.0.42 |
| CVE-2022-21698 | pkg:golang/github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.1.0 | [CVE-2022-21698] CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') | client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.<br /><br />Sonatype's research suggests that this CVE's details differ from those defined at NVD.
