# Percona Monitoring and Management 1.16.0

* **Date**

    November 1, 2018

PMM ([Percona Monitoring and Management](../index.md)) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance. You can run PMM in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for MySQL and MongoDB servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

This release offers three new features for both the Community and Percona Customers:

* Agentless PMM support - Use PMM Server to gather Database Metrics and Queries from remote instances with no PMM Client installed!
* Query Analytics + Metric Series – See Related Database activity alongside queries
* Simplify metrics collections

We addressed 11 new features and improvements, and fixed 21 bugs.

## Agentless PMM support for MySQL and PostgreSQL

You’re now able to connect *PMM Server* to your MySQL and PostgreSQL instances, whether they run in a cloud DBaaS environment, or under Operating Systems which are not natively supported by PMM (e.g. Windows), or when you do not have shell access to the server. This can help you get up and running with PMM using minimal configuration and zero client installation, however be aware there are limitations - *there won’t be any host-level dashboards populated for these nodes* since we don’t attempt to connect to the provider’s API nor are we granted access to the instance in order to deploy an exporter.

### How to use

You’ll be able to collect Metrics and Queries from MySQL, and Metrics from PostgreSQL.  You can add remote instances by selecting the *PMM Add Instance* item in a PMM Dropdown group of the system menu:

where you will then have the opportunity to add a Remote MySQL or Remote
PostgreSQL instance:

You’ll add the instance by supplying just the Hostname, database Username and
Password (and optional Port and Name):

Also new as part of this release is the ability to display nodes you’ve added,
on screen **RDS and Remote Instances**:

### Server activity metrics in the PMM Query Analytics dashboard

The Query Analytics dashboard now shows host and database activity graphs linked to the queries listed in a summary table.  This brings a view of System Activity (CPU, Disk, and Network) and Database Server Activity (Connections, Queries per Second, and Threads Running) to help you better pinpoint query pileups and other bottlenecks.

### Extending metrics with node_exporter textfile collector

While PMM provides an excellent solution for system monitoring, sometimes you may have the need for a metric that’s not present in the list of `node_exporter` metrics out of the box. There is a simple method to extend the list of available metrics without modifying the `node_exporter` code. It is based on the textfile collector.  We’ve enabled this collector as on by default, and it is deployed as part of `linux:metrics` in *PMM Client*.

The default directory for reading text files with the metrics is `/usr/local/percona/pmm-client/textfile-collector`, and the exporter reads files from it with the `.prom` extension. By default it contains an example file  `example.prom` which has commented contents and can be used as a template.

You are responsible for running a cronjob or other regular process to generate the metric series data and write it to this directory.

#### Example – collecting docker container information

This example will show you how to collect the number of running and stopped docker containers on a host. It uses a `crontab` task, set with the following lines in the cron configuration file (e.g. in `/etc/crontab`):

```
*/1 * * * *     root   echo -n "" > /tmp/docker_all.prom; docker ps -a -q | wc -l | xargs echo node_docker_containers_total >> /usr/local/percona/pmm-client/docker_all.prom;
*/1 * * * *     root   echo -n "" > /tmp/docker_running.prom; docker ps | wc -l | xargs echo node_docker_containers_running_total >> /usr/local/percona/pmm-client/docker_running.prom;
```

The result of the commands is placed into the `docker_all.prom` and `docker_running.prom` files and read by exporter and will create two new metric series named `node_docker_containers_total` and `node_docker_containers_running_total`, which we’ll then plot on a graph:
